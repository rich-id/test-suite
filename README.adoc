This bundle is a shortcut to install the whole RichCongress test suite for Symfony. It requires **PHP 7.3+** and **Symfony 4** or **Symfony 5**.

== Quick showcase

The suite gives you a big set of tools to improve the test lisibility, and ensure that every tool work properly without interfearing with each other.

A great drawing is always better than a long speech.
